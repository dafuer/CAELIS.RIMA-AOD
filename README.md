CAELIS: RIMA - ODA
=================

Small example of PhoneGap technology. This little tool can be compiled to run on a lot of mobile OS's.

The example involves obtaining the AOD (parameter related to atmospheric turbidity) closest in time and in space at the current position. The parameter is obtained from the measurement network RIMA (http://www.rima.uva.es/), subnet within AERONET (http://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/). The data is obtained through CAELIS (www.caelis.uva.es), it is its management tool of RIMA network.
